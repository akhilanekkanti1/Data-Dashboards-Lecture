#Where to start?

Workflow!

Your future-self will thank you if you set yourself up for the *option* to make your dashboard public.

**To get a better picture of how abuse and neglect rates in Lane County look, the OCAP study directly asks high school students about their current and previous abuse and harrassment experiences.**

I will present three plots that visualize data in informative ways for policymakers. 

--
1. How abuse rates vary across school districts in Lane County.

--
2. How people in the community respond when students have disclosed their experience. 

--
3. How being in foster care is associated with students' decision to tell someone, relative to their abuse score.
